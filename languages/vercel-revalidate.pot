msgstr ""

msgstr ""
msgid "Is it compatible with all WordPress themes?"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""
msgid "How do I secure my revalidation endpoint?"
msgstr ""
msgid "Always use a secret token and configure it in both this plugin and your Next.js API route."
msgstr ""
msgid "üîí This plugin uses HMAC signature validation by default."
msgstr ""
msgid "All revalidation requests are cryptographically signed to ensure they are authentic and tamper-proof. Your secret key is never exposed in the URL ‚Äî only a hashed version is transmitted. This protects your Next.js site from unauthorized invalidation attempts."
msgstr ""
msgid "‚ö†Ô∏è Important note about Edge Functions (App Router)"
msgstr ""
msgid "If your revalidation endpoint is deployed as an Edge Function (e.g. using the App Router in edge runtime mode), the native Node.js crypto module may not be available."
msgstr ""
msgid "In that case, use the Web Crypto API instead to validate the HMAC signature."
msgstr ""
msgid "Enter the full public URL of your revalidate endpoint. Example: https://yoursite.com/api/revalidate"
